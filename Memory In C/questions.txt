1.  What’s stdint.h?
    -- The <stdint.h> header declare sets of integer types having specified widths, 
       and defines corresponding sets of macros.

2.  What’s the point of using uint8_t, uint32_t, int32_t, and uint16_t in a program?
    -- We use these date types in a program so that we can declare exact-width integer types. 

3.  How many bytes is a BYTE, a DWORD, a LONG, and a WORD, respectively?
    -- BYTE:   is a (1 byte) 8 bit unsigned value (only positive integers).
    -- DWORD:  is a (4 bytes) 32 bit unsigned integer (only positive integers).
    -- LONG:  is a (4 bytes) 32-bit signed integer ( can hold both negative and positive integers).
    -- WORD:  is a (2 bytes) 16-bit unsigned integer (only positive integers).
    

4.  What (in ASCII, decimal, or hexadecimal) must the first two bytes of any BMP file be? 
    Leading bytes used to identify file formats (with high probability) are generally 
    called "magic numbers."
    -- The first two bytes of an bitmap are (hex digits 0x42, 0x4d) and (in ASCII digits 'BM'). 

5.  What’s the difference between bfSize and biSize?
    -- bfSize is the size, in bytes, of the bitmap file.
    -- biSize is the number of bytes required by the structure.

6.  What does it mean if biHeight is negative?
    -- If biHeight is negative, the bitmap is a top-down DIB (Device-Independent Bitmaps) 
       and its origin is the upper-left corner.

7.  What field in BITMAPINFOHEADER specifies the BMP’s color depth (i.e., bits per pixel)?
    -- biBitCount.

8.  Why might fopen return NULL in lines 24 and 32 of copy.c?
    -- If the user fail to input the correct input and output files at the command line argument 

9.  Why is the third argument to fread always 1 in our code?
    -- The third argument is always 1 because we only have 1 element to read from.

10. What value does line 65 of copy.c assign to padding if bi.biWidth is 3?
    -- It will assign a padding of 3 zeros (000).

11. What does fseek do?
    -- It's a file position indicator that keeps track of where in the file we are.

12. What is SEEK_CUR?
    -- It's the current position in file.
